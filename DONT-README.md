# Lasse Brustad's Website

## About
Hi, there!
I'm Lasse Brustad and I do develop websites both with and without backend code!
I was born in 1998, so I'm a young hobbyist dev!

The website I do host at GitHub is only till I get a personal host that support's NodeJS and hopefully is free or very cheap!

I'll try to make sure all the content is both in english and norwegian because it's going to be both norwegian pages and global pages! The norwegian pages will ofcourse just be in norwegian!

## Content
Well, for now I won't add really much stuff because I'm working at developing a clan website with NodeJS backend. I'll try to add some pages about me and what I do and so on at the beginning, then I'll add e.g. small and simple web games!

If you want to improve my english somewhere in any pages, add an issue and tell me a great correction!

## Hire me?
I'm hireable for simple to medium level full-stack web development, but I'm not going to promise the time it will take! I do have a life, so I do only work with development when I feel like `I want to develop now!`

I do not work for free, but I teach peoples and help for free! Just remember, if you ask me about every single thing, I simply stop listening to your questions!

## More?
Not really. I don't have to write a book to give you enough info!
